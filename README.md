Supplemental code and data for the paper
**On Parsing Programming Languages with Turing-Complete Parser**
by Bo≈°tjan Slivnik and Marjan Mernik.

This repository contains the following artefacts:

- [the Java source code](https://github.com/slivnik/LLR-systems/tree/master/src) of the prototype implmentation of the parser generator supporting the full backjumping, limited backjumping and DFA-based algorithms;
- [examples](https://github.com/slivnik/CSR/tree/master/tests) included in the paper.

Please see README files in the subdirectories for more information.
